# C++ Map

This project was originally a mall with shopping areas was later transformed into Snoop Doggs mansion. Had multiple requirements that needed to be done for the C# application to be transformed. Here are some of the features that were converted:

//changed words to a class 
//changed room to a class 
//changed noun to a class 
//changed directions to a vector
//changed verbs to a vector 
//changed noun to a vector
//public - private data members 
//used set & gets 
//changed room array into a vector (2) 
//proper identation of your code 
//create a map 
//added more nouns 
//added more rooms     
//constructors in classes
//re-themed the game	
//activated verb inventory
//activated verb get 
//activated verb examine 					
//static data member for room 


Was an exciting project because of the multiple ways it could of been done, thank you for viewing!
